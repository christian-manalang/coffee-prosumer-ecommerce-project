      <h2>Our Passion, Your Perfect Cup</h2>
      <p>
        Prosumer Brew was founded by a group of passionate coffee enthusiasts who believe that exceptional coffee shouldn't be limited to cafes. We saw a gap between basic home equipment and professional gear, and we wanted to bridge it. Our mission is to empower home baristas like you with the tools, knowledge, and confidence to craft cafe-quality beverages in your own kitchen.
      </p>
      <p>
        We meticulously select and test every product we offer, focusing on quality, performance, and durability. From precision espresso tampers and scales to versatile pour-over drippers and kettles, our curated collection represents the gear we trust and use ourselves.
